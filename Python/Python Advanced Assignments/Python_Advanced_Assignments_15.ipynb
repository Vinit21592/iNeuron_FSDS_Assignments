    "Python 3.8 was released on October 14th, 2019, and introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the notable new features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assignment Expressions (The Walrus Operator):** This new operator (:=) allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. This can make your code more concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positional-only parameters:** You can now mark function parameters as positional-only by using a slash (/) character in the parameter list. This means that the parameters can only be specified by their position, and not by their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **f-strings improvements:** Python 3.8 added support for = to f-strings, which allows you to specify a value to be displayed if a variable is None. Also, f-strings now support debugging, allowing you to see the values of variables in your f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improvements to typing:** Python 3.8 includes several improvements to the typing module, including the addition of TypedDict, a way to define dictionaries with specific key/value types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vectorcall:** Python 3.8 introduced a new calling protocol, called \"vectorcall\", which allows for faster function calls with fewer memory allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Improvements to subprocess:** The subprocess module has been improved in Python 3.8, including new ways to set the environment variables of subprocesses and better handling of subprocess output.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Math functions:** Python 3.8 added several new math functions to the math module, including isqrt (integer square root) and the ability to compute the greatest common divisor of multiple numbers."
